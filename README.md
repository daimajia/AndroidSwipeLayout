This is the brother of [AndroidViewHover](https://github.com/daimajia/AndroidViewHover).

One year ago, I started to make an app named [EverMemo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhan_dui.evermemo) with my good friends. The designer gave me a design picture, the design like this:

I found it was pretty hard to achieve this effect, cause you had to be very familiar with the Android Touch System. It was beyond my ability that moment, and I also noticed that there was no such a concept library...

Time passed, finally...as you see right now.

## Demo

Before I made this, I actually found some libraries (eg.[SwipeListView](https://github.com/47deg/android-swipelistview)) that helps developers to integrate swiping with your UI component. 

But it only works in `ListView`, and it has too many issues that they never care. What a pity!

When I start to make this library, I set some goals:

- Can be easily integrated in anywhere, ListView, GridView, ViewGroup etc.
- Can receive `onOpen`,`onClose`,`onUpdate` callbacks.
- Can notifiy the hidden children how much they have shown.
- Can be nested each other.
- Can handle complicate situation, just like [this](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/d145d9a9508b3d204b70882c05bc3d9bd433883c/687474703a2f2f7777312e73696e61696d672e636e2f6c617267652f3631306463303334677731656b686f6a7379326172673230386530366e6774312e676966).
