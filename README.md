# Android Swipe Layout

This is the brother of [AndroidViewHover](https://github.com/daimajia/AndroidViewHover).

One year ago, I started to make an app named [EverMemo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zhan_dui.evermemo) with my good friends. The designer gave me a design picture, the design like this:

I found it was pretty hard to achieve this effect, cause you had to be very familiar with the Android Touch System. It was beyond my ability that moment, and I also noticed that there was no such a concept library...

Time passed, finally...as you see right now.

## Demo

Before I made this, I actually found some libraries (eg.[SwipeListView](https://github.com/47deg/android-swipelistview)) that helps developers to integrate swiping with your UI component. But it only works in `ListView`. What a pity.

When I start to make this library, I set some goals:

- Can be easily integrated in anywhere, ListView, GridView, ViewGroup etc.
- Can receive `onOpen`,`onClose`,`onUpdate` callbacks.
- Can notifiy the hidden children how much they have shown.
- Can be nested each other.
